NOTE: currently only the Linux version of sysdig is capable of capturing events and doing live analysis. On the other platforms, you will be limited to working with the trace files generated by a Linux installation of sysdig.

### OSX Installation

We don't provide a Mac binary for sysdig [yet](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/issues/16), so you need to compile the program from the sources. Don't worry, the process is very simple and it's a matter of following the 
[compilation instructions](How to Install Sysdig from the Source Code).
