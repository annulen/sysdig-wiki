Sysdigâ€™s chisels are little scripts that analyze the sysdig event stream to perform useful actions. Essentially, they enable you to do really cool stuff with your sysdig data. Just dig the data up, and then use a chisel to shape it into something beautiful. Get it? Awesome!

Chisels are written in LUA, a well known, powerful, and extremely efficient scripting language.
